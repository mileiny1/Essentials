	<p>Our team has come up with a list of things that you REALLY should consider packing when visiting Santo Domingo. You will want to prepare for a tropical Caribbean climate, an active stay in Santo Domingo and its nearby beaches, and of course some down time when you just have to take a break.  Don’t wait until the last minute before you leave (or until you actually arrive) to get these essentials:</p>

		 <h2>Hat:</h2>
		 <p>If you haven’t already experienced it, you should know that the Caribbean sun is hotter than what you are accustomed to at home. A hat can be a great way to help stay cool and avoid a sunburn. Choose something that suits your style and complements your clothing, whether it’s a baseball cap or a Panama hat. We have some suggestions that are particularly suited for the Caribbean!</p>

	<div class="section2">
		<h2>Light Clothing: </h2>
		<p>Shorts and short-sleeve shirts seem to be the tourist uniform of choice, but it is not always the best option. Consider lengthier, light-weight options like long linen skirts and pants to help beat the sun and keep you cool while visiting the incredible sites of the Colonial Zone or people watching from one of the many cafes.</p>
		  
</div>
<div>
<h2>Camera:</h2>
<p>You will definitely want to include a camera on your trip to Santo Domingo, the Colonial Zone and the nearby beaches. Recording some of the most memorable attractions and events of your life is of course an essential part of any trip. You may want to consider a disposable camera or maybe even something waterproof if you plan on making the beach and Caribbean Sea your primary playground!</p>
